#### Individual Roles

**Raphael**: Worked on overall gui structure and adding views.
**Madhavi**: Worked on gui views and menus, and the turtle display.
**Santo**: Designed the parsing algorithm and handling variables, user defined methods, and implementation of various commands, worked on the pen.

#### File to start Project
Main.java in the default package

####  Files used to test the project
You can use any of the test code in data in order to test the program. You can load the test code using the upload code button in the left vertical bar. The code appears in the input box so you can edit it before compiling it.

The program should be able to manage incorrect commands, incorrect submissions to text fields, and opening file choosers without choosing a file.

#### Resource files

All the resource files in these folders are required- editBarResources, resources, resources.IDE, resources.labels, and resources.languages.

#### Information about using program

You can create new views in the bottom left corner. The bottom right contains a text console, where there's an input text box, and an output console with the command history and output history from commands. There's an up arrow functionality which types out the last chunk of code you compiled. 

#### Decisions, Assumptions, Simplifications

We made the decision that tell [ 100 ] would create only one turtle with ID of 100, rather than all the turtles up to 100.  

#### Known Bugs

Askwith for multiple turtles doesn't always work as expected. Also, if the turtle rotates more than 360, it returns a number greater than 360.

#### Impressions of the assignment

The assignment was interesting because of the problem of communication between front end and back end. From the back end point of view, too much of the work was skewed towards the first sprint. Some of the implementation for the first sprint should have been pushed to the second week.
